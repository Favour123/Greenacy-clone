    content: `When it comes to climate action, we often talk about policies, protests, and plastic bans. But there's one powerful group we sometimes overlook: teachers. These everyday heroes already shape the minds of future leaders, so why not help them shape a greener future too?\n\nHere's the truth: teachers are one of our best bets for lasting environmental change. When they understand climate issues and know how to act, they pass that knowledge on to hundreds of students every year. That ripple effect is massive.\n\nSo how do we empower teachers to become environmental champions? Let's break it down.\n\n1. Make Environmental Education Easy to Teach\nMost teachers aren't climate scientists, and they don't need to be. What they need are practical resources, lesson plans, and support from their schools.\n\n2. Celebrate and Support Teacher Initiatives\nRecognize teachers who go above and beyond for the environment. Share their stories and give them a platform.\n\n3. Build a Community of Green Educators\nConnect teachers with each other so they can share ideas and inspiration.\n\nLet's give teachers the tools they need to inspire the next generation of environmental champions!`
